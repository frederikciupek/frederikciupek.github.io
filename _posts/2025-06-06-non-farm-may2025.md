The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"> Labor Department’s non‐farm payroll report </a> , released on June 6, 2025, showed that U.S. employers added 139,000 new jobs in May, surpassing Wall Street’s expectation of 124,000. This figure, while signaling a slight slowdown from April’s 165,000 gain, still came in well above consensus.

Despite the headline that U.S. hiring slowed relative to April through the ADA report that sent stocks higher and yields down, <a hre>f="hhttps://frederikciupek.github.io/blog/2025/labour-market-weakning/"> which I talked about in my latest blog post </a>, the beat versus expectations sent stocks higher on the day (June 6th).

At first glance, one might expect stronger job gains to push markets lower—if markets anticipate fewer rate cuts, the discount rate used in equity valuation edges up, which should depress valuations. Yet equities rallied. To understand why, it helps to break down stock valuation into its two core components:


<ul> <li>Expected Cash Flows</li> <li>Discount Rate</li> </ul>

<div align="center">
$$
V_0 = \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$
</div>

where:
- $V_0$ is the value of stock $i$ in time $t=0$
- $CF_t$ is the expected cash flow at time $t$
- $r$ is the appropriate discount rate
- $N$ is the forecast horizon 


### Expected Cash Flows
At its simplest, a stock’s value is the present value of all future cash flows a company is expected to generate. When the labor market is resilient—even if it’s not scorching hot—corporate revenue and earnings forecasts generally rise, as stronger hiring suggests consumers are employed, spending remains solid, and business activity holds up. In May, the 139,000‐job gain, beating expectations by about 10%, painted a picture of an economy still chugging along, tempering fears of an imminent slowdown

#### Consumer Spending and Corporate Revenues
With payroll gains above forecasts, analysts (the market as a whole) raised their projections for consumer spending growth over the next few quarters. Consumer sentiment is also for the first time in 4 months holding steady at 52.2 according to the<a href="https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/"> University of Michigan Sentiment survey</a> (sentiment is still down 25% YoY however). Retailers, restaurants, and service‐sector firms tend to see topline upside when households feel confident about employment. As a result, consensus S&P 500 earnings forecasts for 2025 and 2026 ticked higher in the hours after the report. Even a modest 1–2% upward revision in aggregate earnings projections can translate into meaningful increases in the sum‐of‐discounted cash‐flows for the index.

Taken together, these factors mean that the expected free cash flows embedded in equity valuations moved upward by more than any corresponding increase in discount‐rate assumptions (as detailed below).

2. Discount Rate
The discount rate in equity valuation models—often proxied by the risk‐free Treasury yield plus an equity risk premium—reflects market expectations for the Federal Reserve’s policy rate path.

#### Rate‐Cut Probability Falls
Heading into the May report, futures markets priced in roughly a 20% probability of 
2-3 25 basis‐point Fed cut by September 2025, 54% change of 1-2 and only a 25% chance of them holding to their current target rate of 425-450 bps. After the stronger‐than‐expected payrolls, that probability fell to around 9.4% for a 2-3 25 basis points cut, an unchanged probability of a 1-2 25bps cut and a much higher 35% change of no cuts — implying markets now expect rates to stay higher for longer. In isolation, this raises the present‐value discount factor, pushing down valuations.

#### 10-Year Treasury Yields Tick Higher
On report day, the 10-year Treasury yield rose from 4.3% to around 4.45% a s bond investors repriced Fed‐funds outlooks. If we translate that move into a higher discount rate—say, adding 15 bps to the forward yield curve assumptions in a discounted cash flow model—it would shave a few percentage points off of valuation multiples, all else equal.

However, in this case, the lift to cash‐flow forecasts (via stronger revenue and modest margin revisions) more than offset the slight upward revision in discount‐rate assumptions. The net effect: a higher present‐value of future cash flows, which sent stocks modestly higher on the day.

## Putting It All Together: Why Stocks Are Up
Stronger Job Gains → Higher Cash‐Flow Projections

Rate‐Cut Odds Dip → Slightly Higher Discount Rate

Futures pricing shifted to imply rates will remain near current levels at least through mid‐2025, raising the discount factor by about 10-15 bps on the long end.

On a DCF basis, that would modestly trim valuations—everything else held equal.

<strong>Net Effect</strong>: Cash‐Flow Lift > Discount‐Rate Drag


## Note: Market Psychology and Positioning
This all only holds in rational markets which we do not operate in. Many investors had already positioned for “bad news = good news,” expecting a downshift in hiring that would turbo‐charge rate‐cut expectations. Instead, the actual stronger print caught some funds off‐guard, spurring short‐covering and tactical buying in growth names, maybe overoptimistic buying.



What Comes Next? I will be watching two things
1. Fed Speak and Forward Guidance: Even as payrolls hold up, the Fed’s communications on inflation and labor‐market slack remain key. If Fed officials lean more hawkish in speeches—emphasizing data dependency—the discount rate could move further upward.

2. Earnings Season Preview: With Q2 corporate results due in July, investors will test whether companies can deliver on the higher cash‐flow projections implied by today’s jobs data. Earnings beats would reinforce current valuation levels; disappointments could quickly reverse the modest rally.
