This severely undershot expectations of 110,000 new jobs for May. The ADP National Employment Report, jointly developed with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, has been published ahead of the more comprehensive report due Friday the 6th of June by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Reuters claims that these reports are uncorrelated. Government data released June 3rd showed that Job openings increased to 191,000 to 7.391 million and Layoffs jump 196,000 - the biggest rise in nine months. Hiring only rises to 169,000




 The market rose higher between 0.2% and 0.3% and the 10-year TY fell from 4.46% to 4.38% as the market is pricing in interest rate cuts in the future. The dollar is close to a multi-year low.
### Why Expectations of Falling Interest Rates Impact the US Dollar and 10-Year Yields

When the market anticipates future interest rate cuts, it affects both the US dollar and 10-year Treasury yields due to the following reasons:

#### 1. Impact on the US Dollar
Interest rates directly influence the attractiveness of a currency. Higher interest rates typically lead to higher returns for investors holding assets denominated in that currency, increasing demand for the currency and strengthening it. Conversely, when interest rates are expected to fall:
- **Lower returns**: Investors anticipate lower yields on US-denominated assets, reducing demand for the US dollar.
- **Capital outflows**: Investors may shift their capital to countries with higher expected returns, further weakening the dollar.

#### 2. Impact on 10-Year Treasury Yields
Treasury yields are inversely related to bond prices. When interest rates are expected to decrease:
- **Higher bond demand**: Investors buy bonds in anticipation of lower future rates, driving up bond prices.
- **Lower yields**: As bond prices rise, yields fall since yield is calculated as the bond's coupon payment divided by its price.

#### Mathematical Relationship
The relationship can be expressed as:
- **Yield formula**: \( \text{Yield} = \frac{\text{Coupon Payment}}{\text{Bond Price}} \)
- As bond prices increase due to higher demand, yields decrease.

For the US dollar:
- **Exchange rate dynamics**: \( \text{USD Demand} \propto \text{Interest Rate Differential} \)
- Lower interest rates reduce the differential, weakening the dollar.

These dynamics explain why expectations of falling interest rates lead to a weaker US dollar and lower 10-year Treasury yields.
