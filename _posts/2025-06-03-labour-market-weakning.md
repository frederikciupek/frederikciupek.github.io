The Job data released on June 4th 2025shows that just <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-trump-tariffs-trade-war-06-04-2025/card/u-s-hiring-slows-again-adp-report-shows-lk7TGwCNs0lm1cUP5LNP">37,000 jobs were created in May,</a> down almost 50% from 62,000 in April according to the ADP National Employment report released Wednesday.

This severely undershot expectations of 110,000 new jobs for May. The ADP National Employment Report, jointly developed with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, has been published ahead of the more comprehensive report due Friday the 6th of June by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Reuters claims that these reports are uncorrelated. Government data released for April showed that Job openings increased to 191,000 to 7.391 million and Layoffs jump 196,000 - the biggest rise in nine months but still remain low despite market uncertainty and there were 1.03 job openings for every unemployed person. Hiring only rises to 169,000. People quitting their jobs shown in orange in the interactive graph below declined by the most since last November declining by 4.5% (November 2024 5%). The measure of people quitting their job is a proxy for consumer and labor market confidence.

This newest ADA data thus is supporting the understanding of ebbing confidence in the labor market.

 The market rose higher between 0.2% and 0.3% and the 10-year TY fell from 4.46% to 4.38% (2% change) as the market is pricing in interest rate cuts in the future. I am very excited for this Friday's nonfarm job report numbers since I believe the 37,000 to be a bit low. But I do believe there is going to be a negative surprise.

 To see exactly how much the market is pricing in rate cuts this year we can have a closer look at the  <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">probabilities assigned to rate cuts by the market</a>. The the next FOMC meeting 13 days away (June 18th) the market is pricing in a 4% probability of a 25bps rate cut in June.
