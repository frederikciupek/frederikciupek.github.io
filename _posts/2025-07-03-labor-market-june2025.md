Everybody has been awaiting this day: nonfarm payrolls for June, the first month of Summer - and they did not disappoint 
The Job data released on July 3rd 2025 shows that just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-03/us-jobs-report-june-2025-key-takeaways-on-employment-payrolls">payrolls increased by 147,000</a>, exceeding nearly all forecasts and pushed the three month average for job gains up from 147,000 in May to 150,000.

The biggest surprise however was the unemployment rate - a key indicator of labor market strength. As a quick refresher, unemployment is such a key indicator for three main reasons:

1. Reflects Labor Market Utilization:
A low unemployment rate means most people who want jobs have them, suggesting high labor demand and economic momentum and is thus a good indicator of GDP growth.

2. Tied to Consumer Spending:
Employed people have income to spend — which fuels two-thirds (68 - 70%) of U.S. economic activity. When unemployment is low, spending typically rises and so does GDP

3. Signals to the Fed:
The Federal Reserve watches the unemployment rate closely when making interest rate decisions. A rising rate may prompt rate cuts to stimulate the economy; a falling one could justify holding or raising rates.

For everybody that has been recruiting this past June, this might come as a big of a shock. 

> "Labor market strength? Everywhere I go I hear and feel the opposite!" 

And you would be correct! Private-sector payrolls rose by only 74,000, below the 100,000 median estimate and the weakest reading since October 2024, when the job market was battered by hurricanes and labor strikes. 

<a href = "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-03/us-jobs-report-june-2025-key-takeaways-on-employment-payrolls" > This June’s job gain was mainly a government affair, with that sector providing 73,000 of the increase.</a> Federal government jobs fell for a fifth month, but hiring at the state and local level propelled the public sector.

With these mixed signals from the payroll numbers, the market impact was diverse as well. For one, the market was already eying rate cuts with a lot of skepticism in July but now these numbers swept away bets on a Fed rate cut in July. 

Some macro-economist argue that we should ignore the total numbers since the private demand for labor is slowing (mirroring more closely what my fellow job-searchers have been experiencing), since tax hikes, restrictive monetary policy and worries about a further trade war are weighting heavily on labor demand.


Others, like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, are likely to interpret this as validation of the central bank’s “wait-and-see” stance. As he recently told lawmakers, a meaningful weakening in the labor market would be the main trigger for renewed rate cuts — and this report doesn’t quite meet that threshold. Wage growth also came in soft at 0.2% month-over-month and 3.7% year-over-year, the slowest pace in nearly a year, which helps the Fed breathe easier on the inflation front.


But even if headline total job growth looks solid, other cracks are forming.

1. The foreign-born labor force - a key driver of employment growth in recent years — has now declined for three straight months, partly due to the Trump administration's mass deportation push.

2. Recurring jobless claims have surged to their highest level since late 2021.

3. The workweek has shortened, another red flag that firms are trimming hours even if they aren’t cutting heads yet.

4. The unemployment rate for Black Americans rose sharply to 6.8%, the highest since early 2022 — underscoring growing disparities.

## Diverging Yield Curve Reaction: What the Market Saw
All these diverse interpretations lead to a diverse market impact as well and this June jobs report sparked a split reaction across the Treasury curve, revealing diverging expectations for short-term monetary policy versus long-term economic fundamentals.

### Short-end yields surged:
The 2-year Treasury yield, which is highly sensitive to Fed policy expectations, jumped 8 basis points to 3.87%, reflecting a swift repricing of near-term rate cut odds. Before the report, traders had priced in around a 25% chance of a July rate cut. Afterward, that dropped to nearly zero. The stronger-than-expected headline payrolls number — despite its heavy government tilt — gave the market enough reason to believe that the Fed can continue to wait for more inflation clarity before cutting.

### Long-end reaction was more muted:
In contrast, the 10-year yield rose a modest 5 basis points to 4.33%, signaling that while investors acknowledged a still-resilient labor market, they remain wary of the underlying softness in private hiring, wage growth, and work hours. This suggests that bond investors see limited upside for long-term growth or inflation, even if a July cut is off the table.

In other words, the market thinks: “Sure, the Fed won’t cut now — but this labor market isn’t strong enough to prevent them from cutting later.”

Flattening Pressure, Fed Uncertainty
This modest steepening in the curve — where short-end yields rose more than long-end yields — reflects how near-term policy expectations have become less dovish, while longer-term structural concerns (slow hiring, weak productivity, trade uncertainty) remain intact.

If private sector hiring remains weak, and wage growth continues to decelerate, the Fed could still move in September. In fact, markets now see a ~75% chance of a cut then, down from 90% pre-report — not a dramatic shift, but enough to reset expectations heading into Q3.

- S&P 500: +0.4% to another record high

- Dollar Index: +0.2% as rate cut bets faded

- Gold: -0.7% as real yields rose

- Bitcoin: +0.2% to $109,454.59 — continuing its correlation-light rally
