Those of us who were following the development of the Big Beautiful Tax Bill (BBTB) over the past few weeks might have read about Sen. Ted Cruz's pitch to cut $1.1 Trillion dollars over the next decade by doing one thing: ending the Feds authority to pay interest rates to banks. 

In particular this refers to the Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB). Let me explain this concept a bit more: 

US banks (or credit unions for example) keep deposits at its local Federal Reserve Bank. These deposits are called **reserve balances**. Since July 29th 2001 the Fed has paid a single rate, the IORB, on all of those balances to its creditors. Before 2021 there was a two-rate system of interest on excess reserves, and interest on required reserves. As the name suggests, require reserves were those minimum reserve requirements that a bank needs to fulfill and excess is everything exceeding that.

Especially pre 2008 these reserve requirements were important. By forcing banks to hold a fixed fraction of deposits at the Fed, the reserve requirements anchored the _demand for reserves_. The Fed then steered the federal funds rate by tweaking supply via open-market operations. Banks that missed the reserve requirements had to pay a penalty rate ("deficiency charge"). Those that over-shot the target could carry up to 4 % of the required reserve balance (RRB) into the next period. ("carry-over'). So how did that requirement anchor the demand for reserves? If a bank risked finishing the period shy of its RRB, its faced a sure penalty, so it would pay almost any rate in the federal funds market to borrow reserves on the last day or two. But balances above the RRB earned zero interest before Oct 2008, so holding a lot of extra had an opportunity cost associated with it. The result was a demand curve that shot up sharply when aggregate reserves fell close to the required level and flatted out when reserves sat safely above it. See a more comprehensive break down <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/log170518?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> here </a>

With that kinked curve, a small daily tweak in the supply of reserves moved the fed-funds rate a lot. That is exactly what the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk did each morning: forecast the system’s demand, then add or drain reserves with overnight repos so that supply intersected the steep part of the curve at the FOMC’s target rate.

In 2008 however congress authorized interest in the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act 2006 and the starring October 2009 the Fed began paying interest on required reserves and interest on excess reserves at the same time. Therefore, the economic cost of carrying reserves vanished, but the legal obligation of calculating and satisfying the required reserve balance still existed every week until March 2020. THe scarcity mechanism described above no longer worked, paving the way for today's ample reserve "floor system".

So why was this IORB introduced to replace the two? In early 2020 the old two-rate system ceased to make sense since reserve requirements were set to 0 and thus, by definition, all deposits the Fed kept were in excess. The rate was first set to 0% to support <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm">_"support the flow of credit to households and businesses"_ </a>

In other words, in responds to the pandemic the Fed shifted its framework of how short term rates are controlled. Instead of engineering a scare supply of reserves, the FOCM committed to controlling them through its administered rates (IORB, ON RRP). This freed up roughly $200 billion of funding that banks could deploy, removed a bookkeeping chore for thousands of (mostly small) institutions, and simplified reserve-maintenance software at the Reserve Banks


Different to the the federal funds rate, <a href='https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reserve-balances.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com'>the IORB </a>  is set by the Federal Reserve Board, not the FOMC, at each policy meeting and is then announced in the post meeting "Implementation Notes".


Understanding where the IORB comes from what does the it actually do and why is it perhaps problematic that Ted Cruz wants to eliminate this interest paid?

The main function of the the IORB is to implement a target range for the federal funds rate. Naturally, banks will not lend reserves (deposits) at a rate below what the Fed itself pays them. The IORB rate therefore forms the floor of the risk free money market interest rates. The reason for this floor is that if a market lender offers funds to a bank below the IORB, the bank can arbitrage by investing in the Fed accounting and earning the spread between the two rates. This opportunity to arbitrage means no rational bank will borrow reserves **above** the floor or **borrow** below them.

Thus, the IORB rate itself becomes the binding policy lever for money market interest rates uncoupled from demand or supply of reserves. Even if aggregate reserves are in trillions, an individual bank still faces the same arbitrage choice each evening. Even for non-banks, large cash investors that do not hold reserve accounts, this more or less holds. The Fed extends the floor to them via the overnight reserve-repurchase agreement (ON RRP). This rate is set around 5bp under the IORB and eliminated these non-banks to lend below the bank floor by introducing this opportunity cost to them.

## Relation to short term interest rates
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) “sets” short-term policy in the traditional way—by announcing a target range for the overnight federal-funds rate. But since 2019 the way the rate is implemented is different. After every meeting the Board of Governors pins down one number inside that range: the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB). Because any bank can earn that rate simply by keeping dollars in its master account at the Fed, IORB acts as a reservation price: no rational bank will lend reserves for less. As a result, the effective federal-funds rate (EFFR) and other overnight bank-to-bank rates gravitate to, or just above, the IORB setting. The Fed reinforces the floor for non-banks with a second administered rate—the overnight reverse-repo (ON RRP) offering rate—so that money-market funds and housing GSEs, which cannot hold reserve accounts, also have a risk-free alternative at the Fed. The two rates together have kept the EFFR locked inside the FOMC’s target range through several tightening moves, even while total reserves have remained in the trillions. 

If Congress were to abolish IORB, as Senator Ted Cruz has proposed, that floor would disappear for banks. Reserves would again pay zero, so holding them would become costly relative to Treasury bills, tri-party repo, or deposits at the ON RRP facility. Large banks would try to move hundreds of billions of dollars overnight into those instruments; smaller banks would scramble to shed reserves by buying securities or funding loans. The EFFR—no longer anchored by a bank-specific reservation rate—would slide toward the ON RRP rate (currently set 5 basis points lower) and could even undershoot it if the facility’s counter-party limits bound. In effect, the Fed would lose the precise day-to-day control it now exercises over its own policy rate. 

To regain control the central bank would have little choice but to shrink its balance sheet rapidly, draining reserves until they again became scarce enough that banks would pay a positive price for them. Analysts at JPMorgan and Barclays estimate the Fed would need to remove on the order of $3–$4 trillion of reserves—an involuntary, accelerated version of quantitative tightening. Selling or allowing that many Treasuries to mature in short order would push bill and repo yields higher, tighten liquidity, and risk repeating the September-2019 funding-market squeeze that forced the Fed to reverse course and add reserves. 

The fiscal arithmetic that motivates the proposal is also murkier than it first appears. Ending IORB would stop direct interest payments to banks, but it would not eliminate payments to ON RRP counterparties, nor would it restore the Fed’s recent net losses to positive territory overnight. Because the Federal Reserve remits all positive net income to the Treasury, any hit to its earnings—say, from selling higher-coupon bonds at a loss to drain reserves—would offset part of the headline “savings.” Higher Treasury borrowing costs caused by market disruption could erode them further. 


In short, IORB is the Fed’s linchpin for translating the FOMC’s target range into actual overnight market rates. Removing it would upend the ample-reserves “floor” framework the United States has relied on since the financial crisis, force a painful and uncertain transition back toward a scarce-reserves regime, and risk significant collateral damage in money markets and public finances—all for fiscal gains that are, at best, highly speculative.
