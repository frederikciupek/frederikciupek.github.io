### Book Review – When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long‑Term Capital Management_ by Roger Lowenstein (2000)
Long‑Term Capital Management’s “genius” label was no marketing flourish. The firm was helmed by Salomon Brothers bond‑trading legend **John Meriwether**, joined by Nobel laureates **Robert Merton** and **Myron Scholes** -the architects of modern option pricing and the widely known Black-Scholes-Merton option formula - and reinforced by a bench of Harvard and MIT professors and PhDs. Yet this intellectual dream team imploded in late 1998 when the Russian‑ruble default sent shock waves through global bond and equity markets.

Roger Lowenstein’s chronicles of this spectacular 1998 collapse of Long‑Term Capital Management (LTCM) is in my opinion required reading for anyone interested in leverage, liquidity, and the limits of quantitative finance. The narrative is brisk, often dramatic, and occasionally moralizing - casting LTCM’s partners as “geniuses” whose hubris and ambition grew in direct proportion to their Sharpe ratios.

## What the book gets right

1. **Storytelling clarity** – Lowenstein explains the mechanics of core LTCM trades - on‑the‑run vs. off‑the‑run Treasury convergence, swap‑spread arbitrage, equity‑index basis trades - without drowning the reader in math. For newcomers, his intuitive sketches are invaluable. I would have personally liked a bit more math on the derivatives, explanation of the models, but alas.
2. **Liquidity as a hidden risk factor** – The book shows how strategies that _seem_ market‑neutral under normal conditions become highly correlated during a funding squeeze. That lesson echoes through every crisis from 2008 to recent crypto blow‑ups. Everything is uncorrelated until you cannot sell anything - then the correlation jumps to 1. Osman Nalbantoglu, Principal at Bridgewater and Prof. at Yale SOM who was teaching our Portfolio Management in Practice course tried to explain exactly that: While we might think our portfolio is diversified based on historical data, what happens if all of the sudden everything crashes? Are we still diversified enough? Are our ideas of volatility based on historical samples still holding? Stress testing this by going through various scenarios to manage exposure is crucial.
3. **Institutional blind spots** – By tracing the fragmented oversight between the Fed, SEC, and dealer credit desks, Lowenstein illustrates how opacity at one hedge fund translated into systemic risk.

## Where I’m unconvinced

After hearing directly from two LTCM principals this semester - **Eric Rosenfeld** (who joined our Portfolio Management class) and **Victor Haghani** (guest lecturer in both Asset Pricing Theory and Fixed Income Securities) - I’m less persuaded by the book’s one‑note “greed” narrative.

* **Models vs. monitoring** – Rosenfeld and Haghani argued that the convergence trades still made economic sense; the failure was in real‑time monitoring of aggregate funding and counterparty risk. That rings truer than the idea that arrogance alone sank the firm.
* **Greed vs. mandate drift** – Where greed _may_ have crept in was LTCM’s decision to stray from bread‑and‑butter Treasury trades into emerging‑market debt, equity vol, and exotic merger arbitrage. Those carried fatter pay‑offs precisely because they were less understood.
* **Critique of derivatives oversight** – The book argues that Alan Greenspan failed to oversee the dangers of an exploding OTC‑derivatives market. I disagree. Derivatives themselves are not the enemy; they are indispensable instruments for transferring and slicing risk. Interest‑rate swaps, futures, and options let pension funds, insurers, and corporates hedge exposures that would otherwise sit unmitigated on balance sheets. The LTCM episode shows that the problem was not the existence of derivatives but rather the concentration of large, leveraged positions without adequate margining, transparency, or governance about these m,margining. LTCM was only able to ballon to what it was because of minimal haircuts and nearly infinite repo financing and by the time Bears Sterns (who cleared the trades) actually saw that it was too late. One could argue that the investment banks' greed was the ultimate LTCM killer. That said, LTCM’s expansion beyond vanilla Treasury convergence into opaque, jump‑risk trades did reflect a hunt for higher returns in unfamiliar territory—a move arguably nudged by the lure of bigger fees. This should have encouraged bigger haircuts however.
> **Ultimate 'bailout'** My last point about the investment banks being at fault is also highlighted here. In late September 1998 the New York Fed convened a dozen major dealer‑banks (e.g., Goldman, J.P. Morgan, Merrill) to inject roughly **$3.6 billion** of capital into LTCM in exchange for 90 % of the fund’s upside. The original partners saw their equity effectively reduced to a sliver. The purpose of the deal was to prevent an uncontrolled liquidation of LTCM’s positions—sales that would have detonated losses on the banks’ own trading books and destabilized the broader bond market. In other words, the rescue protected the Street’s balance sheets, not the hedge fund’s investors. That is why moral‑hazard discussions after LTCM should focus on dealer expectations of central‑bank support rather than on LTCM, which was allowed to fail economically despite the orderly unwind.

## Key takeaways after class discussions

| Theme from the book | What Rosenfeld & Haghani added in class | My synthesis |
|---|---|---|
| “Greed and hubris toppled LTCM.” | Models were largely sound; the blind spot was under‑estimating liquidity shocks and over‑relying on VaR. | Hubris showed up less in the math and more in dismissing worst‑case liquidity scenarios. |
| Risk was hidden in complexity. | Complexity wasn’t lethal; poor _aggregation_ of exposures was. | Complex books can be managed if stress tests and credit lines scale with gross exposure. |
| Regulators rescued the Street, not LTCM. | The consortium bailout was dealer‑driven; LTCM partners were mostly wiped out. | Moral‑hazard debates should focus on banks, not the fund itself. |

## Final verdict

_Read **When Genius Failed** for its vivid narrative and lucid primer on classic fixed‑income arbitrage. Question its easy attribution of failure to “greed,” and focus on deeper lessons about liquidity, leverage, and operational risk._ As class discussions underscored, sophisticated models don’t implode on their own; they break when left unmonitored, when inputs drift far outside historical ranges, or when managers stray too far from strategies they truly understand. LTCM did all three - and that, more than pure avarice, explains why genius failed.
