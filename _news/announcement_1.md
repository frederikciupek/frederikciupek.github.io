Recruiting kind of blows. After having gotten a promising lead everything fell apart when the words every international student dreads were uttered:

"Do you need any sponsorship or work authorization to work in the USA now or in the future?"

I just wish HR in America understood the visa situation for foreigners better. Graduating from an American University, most students have Optional Practical training visa (OPT). With an have everything approved  Employment Authorization Document (EAD) they can now work for one year until they have to extent their OPT (STEM EXTENSION) and then have another 2 years. While some say this is not guaranteed, our Office of International Scholars and Students told us it pretty much is.
 
That means that Yale stays my sponsor and any employer that hires me is not a visa sponsor in the way an H-1B employer would be. So I do not require new visa sponsorship for up to three years.

But that seems to be lost on many.
