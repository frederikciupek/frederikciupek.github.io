<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Everybody has been awaiting this day: nonfarm payrolls for June, the first month of Summer - and they did not disappoint The Job data released on July 3rd 2025 shows that just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-03/us-jobs-report-june-2025-key-takeaways-on-employment-payrolls" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">payrolls increased by 147,000</a>, exceeding nearly all forecasts and pushed the three month average for job gains up from 147,000 in May to 150,000.</p> <p>The biggest surprise however was the unemployment rate - a key indicator of labor market strength. As a quick refresher, unemployment is such a key indicator for three main reasons:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Reflects Labor Market Utilization: A low unemployment rate means most people who want jobs have them, suggesting high labor demand and economic momentum and is thus a good indicator of GDP growth.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tied to Consumer Spending: Employed people have income to spend — which fuels two-thirds (68 - 70%) of U.S. economic activity. When unemployment is low, spending typically rises and so does GDP</p> </li> <li> <p>Signals to the Fed: The Federal Reserve watches the unemployment rate closely when making interest rate decisions. A rising rate may prompt rate cuts to stimulate the economy; a falling one could justify holding or raising rates.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For everybody that has been recruiting this past June, this might come as a big of a shock.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Labor market strength? Everywhere I go I hear and feel the opposite!”</p> </blockquote> <p>And you would be correct! Private-sector payrolls rose by only 74,000, below the 100,000 median estimate and the weakest reading since October 2024, when the job market was battered by hurricanes and labor strikes.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-03/us-jobs-report-june-2025-key-takeaways-on-employment-payrolls" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> This June’s job gain was mainly a government affair, with that sector providing 73,000 of the increase.</a> Federal government jobs fell for a fifth month, but hiring at the state and local level propelled the public sector.</p> <p>With these mixed signals from the payroll numbers, the market impact was diverse as well. For one, the market was already eying rate cuts with a lot of skepticism in July but now these numbers swept away bets on a Fed rate cut in July.</p> <p>Some macro-economist argue that we should ignore the total numbers since the private demand for labor is slowing (mirroring more closely what my fellow job-searchers have been experiencing), since tax hikes, restrictive monetary policy and worries about a further trade war are weighting heavily on labor demand.</p> <p>Others, like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, are likely to interpret this as validation of the central bank’s “wait-and-see” stance. As he recently told lawmakers, a meaningful weakening in the labor market would be the main trigger for renewed rate cuts — and this report doesn’t quite meet that threshold. Wage growth also came in soft at 0.2% month-over-month and 3.7% year-over-year, the slowest pace in nearly a year, which helps the Fed breathe easier on the inflation front.</p> <p>But even if headline total job growth looks solid, other cracks are forming.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The foreign-born labor force - a key driver of employment growth in recent years — has now declined for three straight months, partly due to the Trump administration’s mass deportation push.</p> </li> <li> <p>Recurring jobless claims have surged to their highest level since late 2021.</p> </li> <li> <p>The workweek has shortened, another red flag that firms are trimming hours even if they aren’t cutting heads yet.</p> </li> <li> <p>The unemployment rate for Black Americans rose sharply to 6.8%, the highest since early 2022 — underscoring growing disparities.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="diverging-yield-curve-reaction-what-the-market-saw">Diverging Yield Curve Reaction: What the Market Saw</h2> <p>All these diverse interpretations lead to a diverse market impact as well and this June jobs report sparked a split reaction across the Treasury curve, revealing diverging expectations for short-term monetary policy versus long-term economic fundamentals.</p> <h3 id="short-end-yields-surged">Short-end yields surged:</h3> <p>The 2-year Treasury yield, which is highly sensitive to Fed policy expectations, jumped 8 basis points to 3.87%, reflecting a swift repricing of near-term rate cut odds. Before the report, traders had priced in around a 25% chance of a July rate cut. Afterward, that dropped to nearly zero. The stronger-than-expected headline payrolls number — despite its heavy government tilt — gave the market enough reason to believe that the Fed can continue to wait for more inflation clarity before cutting.</p> <h3 id="long-end-reaction-was-more-muted">Long-end reaction was more muted:</h3> <p>In contrast, the 10-year yield rose a modest 5 basis points to 4.33%, signaling that while investors acknowledged a still-resilient labor market, they remain wary of the underlying softness in private hiring, wage growth, and work hours. This suggests that bond investors see limited upside for long-term growth or inflation, even if a July cut is off the table.</p> <p>In other words, the market thinks: “Sure, the Fed won’t cut now — but this labor market isn’t strong enough to prevent them from cutting later.”</p> <p>Flattening Pressure, Fed Uncertainty This modest steepening in the curve — where short-end yields rose more than long-end yields — reflects how near-term policy expectations have become less dovish, while longer-term structural concerns (slow hiring, weak productivity, trade uncertainty) remain intact.</p> <p>If private sector hiring remains weak, and wage growth continues to decelerate, the Fed could still move in September. In fact, markets now see a ~75% chance of a cut then, down from 90% pre-report — not a dramatic shift, but enough to reset expectations heading into Q3.</p> <p>Market Snapshot:</p> <ul> <li> <p>2Y yield: +8bps to 3.87%</p> </li> <li> <p>10Y yield: +5bps to 4.33%</p> </li> <li> <p>S&amp;P 500: +0.4% to another record high</p> </li> <li> <p>Dollar Index: +0.2% as rate cut bets faded</p> </li> <li> <p>Gold: -0.7% as real yields rose</p> </li> <li> <p>Bitcoin: +0.2% to $109,454.59 — continuing its correlation-light rally</p> </li> </ul> </body></html>
