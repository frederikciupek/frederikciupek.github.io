Hello world. I am a native German finance enthusiast and creative problem solver with a strong passion for leveraging alternative data to drive innovation across finance, economics, and business.

My professional interests center on public equity and debt markets, shaped by hands-on experience from diverse roles: as a quantitative researcher at a German hedge fund, a compensation consultant advising executive boards of major German corporations, and an international tax professional at Deloitte, where I provided tax liability due diligence for mergers involving Japanese companies in Germany.
This multidisciplinary background has provided me with a unique perspective on how multinational companies operate and how strategic decisions are made at the executive level.

Academically, I am interested in the empirical analysis of alternative data and its role in shaping market behavior. I explore how non-traditional data sources - such as product reviews - can provide early signals of company performance, investor sentiment, and macroeconomic trends. I also am interested in how current industry standards, such as peer groups that are so common in mergers or valuations for multiples, can be enhanced with a more sophisticated quantitative approach. In particular my recent research reflects this focus and includes:

•	The impact of Amazon review data on stock performance in Japan and the US

•	The reliability of M&A peer groups and the misvaluation of trading multiples

•	A defensive portfolio strategies using factor models and optimization techniques implementing the theoretical knowledge I have acquired at Yale

You can find a detailed breakdown of these projects in my project section.
